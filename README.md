OpenTox via cURL
================

Examples on how to use [cURL](http://curl.haxx.se/) 
(a widely used command line HTTP client)
to consume web services that are compliant to the 
[OpenTox API v1.2](http://opentox.org/dev/apis/api-1.2).

The goal of [OpenTox](http://opentox.org) is to develop 
an interoperable predictive toxicology framework which 
may be used as an enabling platform for the creation of 
predictive toxicology applications.
OpenTox applications can combine multiple web services 
providing users access to distributed toxicological 
resources including data, computer models, validation 
and reporting. The exemplification of the OpenTox API
is a necessary task towards a complete and comprehensive
documentation of the API as well as for the demonstration
of the abilities of the framework.
